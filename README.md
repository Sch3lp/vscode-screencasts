# VisualStudio Code Screencasts for Mac
These screencasts progress you easily into using shortcuts that will get you more productive.

They're currently available on this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zW7wzhNnUicrd5CGD_YRr1Dp1dXx-G4).

Below are the "chapters" and what you learn in them.

The exercises folder is just there for your ease of working.

# 1-1 • Everything with the mouse
One by one select, copy and paste with mouse

# 1-2 • Copy paste with cmd+c and cmd+v
This time instead of right click, copy :            cmd+c
and instead of       right click, paste:            cmd+v

# 1-3 • Shift+arrow selecting, cmd+c, v
Now we will select text with                        shift+rightarrow 
instead of using the mouse.

You can switch between open files with              cmd+option+rightarrow (right)
and with                                            cmd+option+leftarrow   (left)

# 1-4 • Option+shift+arrow selecting, cmd+c, v
You can move your cursor 
up until "the end of a word" with                   option+rightarrow
same goes for "beginning of word" with              option+leftarrow

Add shift to also select.                           shift+option+rightarrow
                                                    shift+option+leftarrow

# 2-1 • Multicursor in column mode
Add a new cursor below the current line             cmd+option+down
Add a new cursor above the current line             cmd+option+up

The cursor will be added 
where it jumps, so watch out when
your current line is longer than the
one below or above, because your cursor
will jump to the end of that line.

Press Escape to end the multicursor mode.

# 2-2 • cmd+F, find next, cmd+c, v
Find a word (and the NEXT word) with                cmd+f

# 2-3 • Cursor instead of next
Instead of FINDING the NEXT word,
put a CURSOR there with                             cmd+d

You can also use cmd+d to 
instantly SELECT the word where
your cursor is on.

# 2-4 • Skipping selections
Accidentally selected a word?                       cmd+k,cmd+d
So FIRST press cmd+k,
THEN     press cmd+d

This is a combined shortcut, where
cmd+k _primes_ the next shortcut.

# 2-5 • XML Tools extension
Format an XML so you can actually work with it.
1. Install the XML Tools extension!
2. Press shift+option+f to "format"
3. ???
4. Profit

shift+option+f also works on other files (like JSON)

# 2-6 • Shift+cmd+rightarrow when word selection doesn't suffice
Some emails contain more "words" 
and will cause option+shift+rightarrow to 
produce weird results.

To select until the end of the line                shift+cmd+rightarrow
then deselect                                      option+shift+left

To select until the beginning of the line          shift+cmd+leftarrow
then deselect                                      option+shift+right

# 2-7 • Wrapping a selection
Bonus!
Wrapping selected text with 'single', 
"double quotes", (or) [various] {braces}.
This works great in conjunction with multicursor.

# 2-8 • Setting the Language of an untitled file
Wrapping with angular braces: <>
only works when the "language" is XML.

Language:                                          cmd+k, m

First press cmd+k,
then        m

# 2-9 • cmd+F2 is faster than cmd+d
If you're 100% sure you won't 
get unwanted selections,
instead of repeatedly pressing                     cmd+d
you can press once                                 cmd+F2

Good luck, Have fun out there! ♥♥♥

# Look for patterns, then apply multicursor
Examples:
* I'm going to need all of the email addresses out of an XML.
* Putting comma-separated values on a new line (select ',', cmd+d, press enter).

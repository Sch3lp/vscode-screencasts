# VisualStudio Code Screencasts
These screencasts progress you easily into using shortcuts that will get you more productive.

They're currently available on this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMDuDZ0tKz4&list=PL0zW7wzhNnUgnpEA9WaWKsp28fuOZZqiL).

Below are the "chapters" and what you learn in them.

The exercises folder is just there for your ease of working.

# 1-1 • Everything with the mouse
One by one select, copy and paste with mouse

# 1-2 • Copy paste with ctrl+c and ctrl+v
This time instead of right click, copy :            ctrl+c
and instead of       right click, paste:            ctrl+v

# 1-3 • Shift+arrow selecting, ctrl+c, v
Now we will select text with                        shift+rightarrow 
instead of using the mouse.

You can switch between open files with              ctrl+PageDown (right)
and with                                            ctrl+PageUp   (left)

# 1-4 • Ctrl+Shift+arrow selecting, ctrl+c, v
You can move your cursor 
up until "the end of a word" with                   ctrl+rightarrow
same goes for "beginning of word" with              ctrl+leftarrow

Add shift to also select.                           shift+ctrl+rightarrow
                                                    shift+ctrl+leftarrow

# 2-1 • Multicursor in column mode
Add a new cursor below the current line             ctrl+alt+down
Add a new cursor above the current line             ctrl+alt+up

The cursor will be added 
where it jumps, so watch out when
your current line is longer than the
one below or above, because your cursor
will jump to the end of that line.

Press Escape to end the multicursor mode.

# 2-2 • Ctrl+F, find next, ctrl+c, v
Find a word (and the NEXT word) with                ctrl+f

# 2-3 • Cursor instead of next
Instead of FINDING the NEXT word,
put a CURSOR there with                             ctrl+d

You can also use ctrl+d to 
instantly SELECT the word where
your cursor is on.

# 2-4 • Skipping selections
Accidentally selected a word?                       ctrl+k,ctrl+d
So FIRST press ctrl+k,
THEN     press ctrl+d

This is a combined shortcut, where
ctrl+k _primes_ the next shortcut.

# 2-5 • XML Tools extension
Format an XML so you can actually work with it.
1. Install the XML Tools extension!
2. Press shift+alt+f to "format"
3. ???
4. Profit

shift+alt+f also works on other files (like JSON)

# 2-6 • Shift+end when word selection doesn't suffice
Some emails contain more "words" 
and will cause ctrl+shift+rightarrow to 
produce weird results.

To select until the end of the line                shift+end
then deselect                                      ctrl+shift+left

To select until the beginning of the line          shift+home
then deselect                                      ctrl+shift+right

# 2-7 • Wrapping a selection
Bonus!
Wrapping selected text with 'single', 
"double quotes", (or) [various] {braces}.
This works great in conjunction with multicursor.

# 2-8 • Setting the Language of an untitled file
Wrapping with angular braces: <>
only works when the "language" is XML.

Language:                                          ctrl+k, m

First press ctrl+k,
then        m

# 2-9 • ctrl+F2 is faster than ctrl+d
If you're 100% sure you won't 
get unwanted selections,
instead of repeatedly pressing                     ctrl+d
you can press once                                 ctrl+F2

Good luck, Have fun out there! ♥♥♥

# Look for patterns, then apply multicursor
Examples:
* I'm going to need all of the email addresses out of an XML.
* Putting comma-separated values on a new line (select ',', ctrl+d, press enter).
